# MacOS_SandboxEntitlements

This is an example of setting up a macOS App that needs access outside the App Sandbox environment.

The original project was developed using c++ and the Qt 6 SDK.  An XCode project is provided.  

The Xcode project will not work without the Qt SDK being installed.  Even with the Qt SDK it still may not work.

If need be recreate the Xcode project with Qt (ie:qmake) or create a new Xcode project from scratch if you are developing in pure Objective-C.
